## Development

This repo uses a single-commit public branch strategy:

- Each update replaces the previous commit
- Full history maintained in private source repo
- Force pushes are normal and expected

### Why?

1. Public site doesn't need version history
2. Clean public repo
3. Full history available privately
4. Simple deployment workflow
